# Runway Digital Image Analysis Tool
***
## Description
This tool uses digital image analysis techniques coupled with established fashion design principles such as _shape_, _line_, and _color_ to garner information from sets of images collected from runway fashion shows.

## Goals and Purpose
What is it that defines "good" and "bad" fashion decisions? Why does a cardigan from the 2000s look so dated, but a suit jacket is universal? Where is the line for couture runway looks and our day-to-day clothing choices?

Likewise, how do humans make "good" and "bad" decisions using their sight and personal experiences? Why can we collectively decide that something we see every day is universal or "historical"? Where do our eyes and minds define the line and relationship between unrealistic media expectations and day-to-day social expectations?

And finally: When we live in a world of constantly new media input, can we make this process easier and standardized through the use of computers?

Computer Vision and Image Analysis technology is used in image processing for food analysis<sup>[1]</sup> and animal sciences<sup>[2]</sup>, neural network object detection<sup>[3]</sup>, and even image processing of audio waveforms<sup>[4]</sup>. The research that is being done in this field can be separated into three general, but distinct, areas of study: 

**Digital Image Processing** deals with the process of obtaining a visual signal and making it interpretable -- this process involves the conception, design, development, and enhancement of digital imaging algorithms and programs<sup>[5]</sup>.

**Digital Image Analysis**, also known as Digital Imaging, is the process of extracting meaningful information from an image, including descriptive statistics like global image metrics, color histograms and distribution, and block statistics across images<sup>[2]</sup>.

**Computer Vision** handles the development of artificial systems that answer visual questions using the above techniques of Image Processing and Image Analysis combined with Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition<sup>[6]</sup>.

The Fashion Industry constantly evolves and changes at a breakneck pace as a symptom of long-existing seasonal clothing cycles coupled with the widespread use of the internet and social media<sup>[7, 10]</sup>. Likewise, runway fashion has a major influence on how these trends form and are accepted by the majority of designers and retailers, which then influences our clothing choices in our day-to-day life. The influence of individual clothing decisions through our use of social media alongside the influence of designers on marketing and retail acts as a cyclical system by which we choose what to buy at a store<sup>[8, 9]</sup>.

Our ability to parse information that is presented to us so quickly can be difficult -- especially for individuals who don't follow trends or who follow them sparsely. To make this process easier for designers and consumers, there are a number of principles that exist within fashion which may be used to better understand how apparel should look according to current trends. This is especially useful when parsing a couture or designer runway outfit that may look closer an abstract art piece instead of a piece of clothing<sup>[11]</sup>.

The principles that exist overlap somewhat and are more or less depending on the amount of generalization between each, but major features include:

**Color** is a pretty self-explanatory element of fashion, but includes the types and tones of colors used in fabrics as well as their combinations through prints or different outfit pieces<sup>[8,12]</sup>.

**Shape, Form, and Silhouette** represent the structure and literal shapes used in clothing as well as the overall image presented by the entire outfits silhouette without detail<sup>[12]</sup>.

**Line** is the literal use of lines within an outfit -- from seam lines, to hemlines, to strap lines. In an outfit lines are the result of edges meeting, whether those lines are within a specific piece of clothing, or between different pieces of clothing an accessories, or even between the clothing and the body<sup>[12]</sup>.

**Texture** and to a similar extent **Print** are the qualities of the material used in the clothing itself, including characteristics such as look, feel, busyness, rigidity, fluidity, weight, matte/gloss, and so on<sup>[11, 12]</sup>.

**Negative Space** goes hand-in-hand with silhouette and represents the cutaway parts from clothing that exposes the skin or features underneath. The absence of a garment in a negative space creates another feature of the outfit using the human body itself, illustrating the opposite of the clothing silhouette by creating an interesting human silhouette of skin and body<sup>[12]</sup>.

**Symmetry** and its antithesis of Asymmetry make up the features of Balance in clothing which can be very striking in the presence or lack of reflection between halves of an outfit<sup>[12]</sup>.

In 2019, the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee reported that the fashion industry made up a USD 2.5 Trillion global industry and employed more than 1.5 million peoples in the United States alone<sup>[10]</sup>. For some fashion is a hobby, for others it isn't even something that they think about, and for even more it is their core interest, but for many it is their livelihood. This tool looks to provide the individual person with the power and understanding to make their own informed consumer decisions and place the ability to parse information and learn from it in thier own hands.

***Developer Note***

This is one of my first serious projects that I'm working on out of my own interest and I can't guarantee that it will be good or effective, but I hope that it becomes a prototype and launching point for my future endeavours in cross-disciplinary fields.
